# velocity
Web application to retrieve people profiles matching a given user name.

# Brief description
This web application was designed to comply with the MVC pattern. This was done in order to separate the page layout from the flow control and data manipulation.

In order to prevent conflics between the variables and functions names of the different sources, the model and controller code were organized using [W3C recommendations](http://www.w3.org/wiki/JavaScript_best_practices#Avoid_globals).

Finally, unit tests for the model's functions are provided in the test folder.
